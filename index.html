    <h2>The Origin of Spidermando</h2>
      <p>
        Peter Parker always wanted to become an military commando when he grew up. Ever since he was 5, he carried within himself a sense of duty and purpose: to become the best military commando there ever was. However, at military camp, a little mishap happened. While fighting pesky golden eagles for food one evening, a small red spider bit him and he was instantly put into a coma. However, when he reawakened, something wasn’t the same. He now had thousands of small hooks on his fingertips that allowed him to scale walls with ease! Also, he recently picked up a new trend where everyone wore a red mask on their face. But in the end, he decided he wouldn’t be just a regular “commando” anymore. Forever grateful for the spider that changed his life forever, he changed his name to a mixture of his two passions: <b>Spidermando</b>. 
        <br>

    <h2>Venom</h2>
    <p>
      Level two boss. This man is a bit harder to finish. Venom takes 50 shots to kill, and his projectiles deal 5 damage to you per shot. His bullets are also a bit faster than the Green Goblin's, so you better stay on your fingertips.
